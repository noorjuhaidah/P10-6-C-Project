Class Management System (CMS)

Project Overview

The Class Management System (CMS) is a simple database management system designed to manage student records for a class. It allows users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on student records stored in a text file. This system facilitates efficient management of student data for educational purposes.

The CMS interacts with a text-based database file, where each student’s record includes their unique ID, name, programme, and marks. The program supports features such as sorting, querying, updating, deleting, and saving records.
